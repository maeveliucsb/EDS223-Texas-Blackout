# EDS223-Texas-Blackout
This repo reviews the impacts of the 2019 Texas blackouts  using a variety of visual and statistical tools, including line and bar plots and percentage tables. This repository relies primarily on EJscreen, Night light data, and Socioeconomic data.

If a bug is spotted-shoot me an email (maeveli@ucsb.edu) and we can figure out together what's going on. Include the code ran, the error message recieved, and a screenshot of what you're working with. I'd appreciate it if you didn't contribute to this! Its my work for a class and a record of my process for research.

I will be the sole author and contributor to this homework assignment. The assignment was written by Ruth Oliver.
